# LMS-CLI-Minimal

**Provides code to enable working with the LMS Command Line Interface via JSON-RPC.** 

## LMS Command Line Interface
The Lyrion Music Server (LMS) has a Command Line Interface which can be used via JSON/RPC and via Telnet. The JSON/RPC is simpler to use, responses are easier to read etc.

The JSON/RPC interface can be accessed using any language or mechanism capable of handling JSON/RPC - that includes Python, Javascript.

The purpose of this Repo is to provide a minimal amount of code to assist users to get started with the CLI. This Repo is **not** intended to be a comprehensive library for interaction with LMS etc.

## What Repo contains
For each language included there will be:

* a module or code chunk which can handle JSON/RPC connections to LMS
* a few examples of how that code can be used with the LMS CLI command

## LMS CLI Documentation
